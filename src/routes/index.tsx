					<h1>AGI achieved; now what?</h1>
				</header>

				<section>
					<p>
						Let's first address what AGI â€” Artificial General Intelligence â€” is.
					</p>

					<p>
						There is a wide range of definitions across the tech industry, but
						they all seem to converge into a human-level sort of artificial
						intelligence.
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>
							"[...] with capabilities that rival human cognitive functions"
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					<blockquote>
						<p>
							"[...] can demonstrate human-like intelligence across multiple
							domains"
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					<blockquote>
						<p>"[...] that can match or exceed human reasoning abilities"</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						Considering the focus on <strong>intelligence</strong>, it's natural
						to think of it as a model. More specifically a large language model,
						as those are the ones that feel intelligent today.
					</p>

					<p>
						But here is the thing: by that definition, it's been achieved long
						ago. Likely with the introduction of GPT-4, and it's easy to
						evidence that no single human could beat it on a wide test.
					</p>

					<p>
						By wide I mean on a mixed range of disciplines, industries, areas,
						whatever.
					</p>

					<p>In fact, let's exercise this now.</p>

					<p>
						I've asked 4 questions to GPT 4.1 mini (the worst currently
						available model on ChatGPT), plus a double check by o3 (which is a
						system, not a model â€” more on that below).
					</p>

					<ol>
						<li>
							Write Rust code (with unit tests) that applies SIMD-vectorized
							ReLU to a f32 slice using std::arch.

						</li>

						<li>
							Create a decision flowchart for diagnosing iron-deficiency anemia
							in primary care using ferritin, transferrin saturation, CRP, and
							colonoscopy referral thresholds.

						</li>

						<li>
							Prove every finite group of order pÂ² is abelian.

						</li>

						<li>
							Draft a GDPR-compliant privacy notice for a wearable glucose
							monitor that transfers data to U.S. servers, citing legal bases
							and retention limits.

							</Link>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p>
						<Link href="/media/can-you.png">Can you</Link> answer them all?
					</p>

					<p>Can anyone?</p>

					<p>Speaking for myself, I can barely understand the questions.</p>

					<p>Maybe a PhD could answer... one of them.</p>

					<p>
						Of course if I had an infinite amount of time and access to all
						human tools (like the internet), I could. But that's not what it
						did.
					</p>

					<p>
						All answers came in less than 3 seconds and on the first try. It's
						like if you replied instantly, word by word, with no prior search,
						no backspace, no drafting; nothing. Just pure instant answer like
						you do when asked what's 2+2.
					</p>

					<h2>
						So why I'm not <em>feeling the AGI</em>?
					</h2>

					<p>Or more importantly, why do I still have to work?!</p>

					<p>
						Well, let's picture what it takes to actually{" "}
						<strong>create value</strong>. i.e. supply a product or provide a
						service that helps someone.
					</p>

					<p>
						Say I want to publish a book on software development, which is a
						topic I'm comfortable with since I've been doing it for ~15 years.
					</p>

					<p>
						Can I do it on a single session, like the GPT examples above? Can I
						sit down, open my preferred text editor, and just type it word by
						word until it's done?
					</p>

					<p>Of course not!</p>

					<p>I need to iterate (a lot!) on it.</p>

					<p>
						I'll write, re-write, research, change my mind, read it again and
						again, fix typos, and lot more, until it's done. And that takes
						time!
					</p>

					<p>
						In fact,{" "}
						<Link href="https://reedsy.com/studio/resources/how-long-does-it-take-to-write-a-book">
							it's said
						</Link>{" "}
						to take <strong>something between weeks and years</strong> to write
						any publishable book.
					</p>

					<p>
						Stephen King, a professional writer,{" "}
						<Link href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-long-does-it-take-to-write-a-book">
							strives to write 10 pages per day
						</Link>
						.
					</p>

					<p>
						So <strong>intelligence</strong> â€” the ability to coherently predict
						the future â€” plus the drive to achieve something,{" "}
						<strong>is not enough</strong>.
					</p>

					<p>
						You also need a <strong>feedback loop</strong>.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>So... a loop, huh?</h2>

					<p>Let's break it down.</p>

					<p>
						The loop is a simple concept, repeating the same action until a
						condition is met.
					</p>

					<p>
						And the feedback is an evaluation of the current state â€” a
						judgement. It answers the question{" "}
						<code>is the condition met?</code>. Or, in other words{" "}
						<code>should the loop stop or continue?</code>.
					</p>

					<img src="../media/feedback-loop.png" alt="Feedback loop diagram" />

					<p>
						If you are following AI progress, it might have rang a bell on you
						already, because that's what reasoning (a.k.a. Chain of Thoughts
						a.k.a. test-time compute) is all about. <strong>Iterating.</strong>
					</p>

					<p>
						There are "hard" tasks, like math, where the output is either right
						or wrong. But that's not true for most things. Creative things!
					</p>

					<p>
						On those, the more you iterate, the better it gets. Forever, but
						logarithmically. You can always keep going, but the improvement for
						each iteration gets lower.
					</p>

					<p>It's that simple.</p>

					<img src="../media/log-growth.png" alt="Logarithmic growth curve" />

					<p>Think about how you write an email.</p>

					<p>
						You start with a few words, read them, delete some, replace others,
						make it longer, then shorter. You change the tone, add details, add
						attachments... You essentially iterate until you evaluate it as
						"good enough".
					</p>

					<p>
						Sometimes it's not as good as you'd like, but your time is
						constrained, so you move on to the next task.
					</p>

					<p>That's also how it works for AIs.</p>

					<p>
						OpenAI's o1,{" "}
						<Link href="https://openai.com/o1/">announced in Sep. 2024</Link>,
						was the first model to introduce a feedback loop, along with the
						idea of a "thinking budget" â€” the analog of your time on the example
						above.
					</p>

					<p>
						Since then, all major LLM providers have introduced "reasoning
						models", setting it as an industry standard.
					</p>

					<img src="../media/arc-agi.png" alt="ARC-AGI benchmark results" />

					<p>
						Those are o3 results on a very popular benchmark for AGI â€”{" "}
						<Link href="https://arcprize.org/leaderboard">ARC-AGI-1</Link>. Note
						that adding more resources (budget) results in a better score, but
						each step improves it less â€” effectively getting more and more
						expensive the more you iterate.
					</p>

					<p>
						That leads us into the conclusion that virtually any task is doable,{" "}
						<strong>given enough resources</strong>.
					</p>

					<p>
						The real question is: <strong>is it viable?</strong>
					</p>

					<p>
						I should also mention that there is a second hidden cost:{" "}
						<strong>time</strong>. The ultimate nature currency!
					</p>

					<p>
						So from now on, I'll refer to the combined cost of time and money as{" "}
						<strong>energy</strong>.
